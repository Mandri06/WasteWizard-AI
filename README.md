# WasteWizard AI üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóëÔ∏è

*An intelligent assistant designed to demystify recycling and help users properly sort waste according to local regulations.*

---

## üéØ The Problem

Waste sorting rules are often confusing, inconsistent, and vary significantly from one city to another. This complexity leads to incorrect disposal, which contaminates recycling streams and undermines sustainability efforts. Many people want to recycle correctly but lack an easy and immediate tool to guide them.

## ‚ú® The Solution

WasteWizard AI aims to be a simple, intuitive, and accessible tool that provides instant, accurate information on how to dispose of any item. By leveraging AI, this project provides users with clear instructions tailored to their specific location, starting with the city of Padua, Italy.

The ultimate vision is an app that can recognize waste items through a smartphone camera and provide immediate sorting guidance, making proper recycling effortless for everyone.

## üöÄ Key Features (Current & Planned)

* **Intuitive Search:** A simple text-based input to ask where an item should be thrown away.
* **Location-Specific Rules:** The logic is built to handle specific regulations, starting with a database for Padua.
* **(In Progress) AI-Powered Logic:** Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle queries for items not yet in the database and provide more detailed explanations.
* **(Future) Image Recognition:** The next major step is to implement a feature allowing users to identify waste items simply by taking a photo.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend & Logic:** Python
* **Web Interface:** Streamlit (for rapid prototyping and a clean UI)
* **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
* **(Planned) Computer Vision:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch
